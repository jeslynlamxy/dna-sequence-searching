# dna-sequence-searching
implemented brute force and boyer moore search algorithms

ensured that input fna files are chunked before search commences to not overload machines

created a process where you automate the checking of your algorithms

by making the code check for the results for you

and generating dna sequences to test for speed and performance of algorithms
